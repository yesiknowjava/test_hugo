</div> Flin Energy FlinInfini Lite is an On-Grid Pure Sine Wave solar inverter. It allows you to store energy and send the excess solar energy back to the grid. In case of power cuts, the inverter powers your load from solar power and batteries and automatically disconnects from the grid. Besides, it comes with a grid-tie function that combines grid, solar, and batteries to power your load. With sufficient solar power availability, loads will get powered by solar energy. Otherwise, the inverter will take the balance from the grid, and the batteries will be saved for use in power cuts. You can decide and use the battery power as per your requirements. FlinInfini Lite allows you to enable or disable net metering. You can disable it if it is not permitted in your locality. Besides, the solar inverter is customizable with 30 plus settings. It comes with an in-built solar power generation meter and can connect up to 6 systems in parallel.
