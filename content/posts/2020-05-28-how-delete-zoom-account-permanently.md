As more people have started working from home, it has led to a rise in the usage of Zoom, a video calling and conferencing app. However, a number of security issues have also been discovered with Zoom that could make a lot of people wary of using it. Plus, the competition has also stepped up its game with Google Meet and Microsoft Teams now able Zoom replacements. If you are done using Zoom due to security reasons then it is best to delete the account permanently. Getting rid of a Zoom account is probably the most uncomplicated process when it comes to the deletion of any online account. However, there is one small catch. If you are a premium user, i.e., Paid users who have subscribed to one of the Zoom Plans, then you need to cancel the subscription first. 

### How to Cancel Your Zoom Subscription

**Step 1:** Go to the <a href="https://www.zoom.us/billing" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Billing</a> section. If asked to sign-in, do so. **Step 2:** Under the Current Plans tab,**Â **click on the Cancel Subscription link. It will stop the automatic renewal of the subscription.<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2633" src="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cancel-subscription-billing.png" alt="cancel Zoom subscription billing" width="640" height="249" srcset="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cancel-subscription-billing.png 640w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cancel-subscription-billing-300x117.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /> **Step 3:** You will be prompted again to confirm if you want to cancel your Zoom subscription. It will then again prompt for confirmation, click on the Cancel Subscription button. Zoom may ask for feedback, which is optional. Note: If instead of cancel subscription, you get a link or info which says Contact Sales, then you should get in touch with Zoom&#8217;s support directly.

## **How to Delete Your Zoom Account Permanently** Before we start with the steps, be aware that once you request for deletion of your Zoom account, it cannot be recovered. Unlike Google Account, where you still can recover deleted Gmail account if requested on time, you lose access to everything related to Zoom. 

**Step 1:** Open the [Zoom Account Page][1] in your browser. You will be prompted to sign-in. Make sure to sign-in using the same account which you plan to delete. **Step 2:** If you signed in with Google or Facebook, it is best to remove the connection. If the account gets into the wrong hand, your connected account can be misused. **Step 3:** Under basic information in Account Profile, click on the link that says &#8220;Terminate my account.&#8221;<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2634" src="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Delete-teriminate-zoom-account-700x475.png" alt="Delete terminate zoom account" width="696" height="472" srcset="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Delete-teriminate-zoom-account-700x475.png 700w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Delete-teriminate-zoom-account-300x204.png 300w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Delete-teriminate-zoom-account-768x521.png 768w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Delete-teriminate-zoom-account-696x472.png 696w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Delete-teriminate-zoom-account-619x420.png 619w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Delete-teriminate-zoom-account.png 1015w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /> **Step 4:** Zoom will show a pop-up window where you will be prompted to confirm that you are sure about the deletion of your account.
