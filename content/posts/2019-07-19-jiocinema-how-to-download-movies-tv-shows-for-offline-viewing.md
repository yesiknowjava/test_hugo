Until and unless you are downloading videos on an Android tablet with a high-resolution display, my recommendation would be to **stick to the &#8216;Medium&#8217; quality**. The &#8216;High&#8217; quality takes up a lot of space for an improvement in quality that most users will be hard-pressed to notice. For TV shows, you can select the episode or season and then press the download button. **Note:** If you have installed an SD card on your Android device, it will automatically ask you to select if you want to download the video on the internal or external storage. 

### Where are the downloads available? You can find all the downloaded content by tapping on the hamburger menu on the top left and select 

**My Downloads**. You can view the remaining disk space, pause the current download, delete the videos, and can sort by type of video. Jio also offers a dedicated section &#8220;Available for Download&#8221; in the menu. It lists all movie and TV shows which can be downloaded. **Related:** How to [download Prime Video offline][1] to watch it later _Facing any issues while trying to download videos in Jio Cinema for offline content?
