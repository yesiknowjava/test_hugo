There is a reason why Google Chrome is the most popular web browser on the internet today. It comes with plenty of features and options and thanks to extensions support; it is highly customizable as well. While installing extensions on Google Chrome is relatively easy, uninstalling them is not. The bigger problem is that many users end up installing rogue plugins in Chrome, which silently steals their browsing history and other personal data. Thus, even if you never ended up installing an extension in Google Chrome, I would still strongly recommend you to double-check this as unknowingly many users end up installing malicious extensions and Chrome apps. In this post, we will share how to uninstall extensions and chrome apps. 

### How to Uninstall Chrome Apps and Extensions in Google Chrome

**Step 1: **Tap the 3-dot overflow menu button on the top-right corner of Chrome. Go to **More Tools -> Extensions**.<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-521 size-large" title="Uninstall Extensions and Chrome Apps" src="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Chrome-extensions-600x451.jpg" alt="Chrome Extensions setting" width="600" height="451" srcset="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Chrome-extensions-600x451.jpg 600w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Chrome-extensions-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Chrome-extensions-80x60.jpg 80w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Chrome-extensions-265x198.jpg 265w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Chrome-extensions-696x523.jpg 696w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Chrome-extensions-559x420.jpg 559w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Chrome-extensions.jpg 747w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> Alternatively, you can type this in Chrome&#8217;s Omnibox: **chrome://extensions**. **Step 2: **A new Chrome tab will open, displaying all the extensions and apps installed. You have the option of disabling them, or you can outright uninstall them by selecting the Remove option.<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-522" title="Uninstall Extensions and Chrome Apps" src="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Chrome-remove-extensions.jpg" alt="Chrome Remove Extensions" width="627" height="289" srcset="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Chrome-remove-extensions.jpg 1296w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Chrome-remove-extensions-300x138.jpg 300w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Chrome-remove-extensions-768x354.jpg 768w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Chrome-remove-extensions-600x277.jpg 600w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Chrome-remove-extensions-696x321.jpg 696w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Chrome-remove-extensions-1068x493.jpg 1068w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Chrome-remove-extensions-910x420.jpg 910w" sizes="(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px" /> 

### Use Chrome Extensions and Apps on Specific Websites In some instances, you might not want to disable a Chrome extension or app but would only want to use it on specific websites. That&#8217;s possible as well. Just follow the steps below. 

**Step 1: **Go to the Extensions page in Chrome. Click the **Details** button of the Chrome app or extension you want to enable for only selected websites. **Step 2: **Under Site access, you will see three options: On click, On specific sites, and On all sites. Select the _On specific sites option_ and then enter the website on which you would want the extension or Chrome app to work. You will have to add each new site manually by clicking the Add button. If there are several websites on which you would like to use a particular extension or website, the smart move would be to use the **On click **option. That way, you can use the extension on any website you want to by simply clicking on it.
