Are you wondering what [VPN works bes][1]t for watching Hulu outside of the USA? In this guide, I will tell you the best Hulu VPNs for watching HD videos from anywhere.

Hulu is one of the most prominent streaming services in your mind when looking for a platform to stream some of the best TV series and best movies on Hulu. It is fast at airing recent TV episodes, and it has a great selection of original films and shows.

Hulu is a subscription-based video-on-demand service operated by The Walt Disney Company. It is currently available in the USA only. Hulu&#8217;s content is geo-restricted in every other region, so Americans are the only ones who can access it. However, with a Hulu VPN, you can mask your IP address and fake your location to access Hulu from anywhere.

### <a></a>Why use a VPN with Hulu?

Users outside the United States cannot stream Hulu shows and movies without a U.S.-issued payment method and an IP (internet protocol) address, which is a personal identifier attached to your device by your internet service provider when you log on to a local network. A virtual address is similar to a physical address on a computer, mobile phone, or tablet.

The IP address part is where a VPN comes into play. A VPN is a service that creates a private, secure connection over the internet by routing your device&#8217;s traffic through its private servers to the uninitiated. By using encryption, you shield your personal information and online activities from prying eyes at your ISP, and &#8211; most importantly &#8211; you create a temporary IP address that hides your actual location.

### <a></a>How to Watch Hulu from Anywhere with a VPN

Here&#8217;s how to use a VPN to watch Hulu before we suggest the best VPN for Hulu.

  * Sign up for a VPN that has high-speed servers in the US, such as **ExpressVPN.**
  * Log in to the VPN provider with your credentials.
  * Connect to a US-based server to stream Hulu.
  * After connecting with a US IP address, visit the Hulu website or app on your device to enjoy limitless access to your favorite shows and movies.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

## <a></a>The Best Hulu VPNs for Watching HD Videos

A virtual private network (VPN) hides your IP address, making Hulu think you&#8217;re accessing content within the US. Here are some of the best VPNs which can help you access the videos:

<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <strong>ExpressVPN </strong>— Super-fast with unmatched ability to bypass geographical restrictions
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>NordVPN</strong> — Largest U.S. server network and smart play technology
  </li>

Due to the network&#8217;s wide range of servers, you can unblock Hulu without worrying about slowing down your connection because of server crowding.

As well as this, ExpressVPN allows five connections to be active simultaneously. It&#8217;s combined with uncapped data and bandwidth limits; this means your entire family can binge-watch Hulu content simultaneously. If you use ExpressVPN&#8217;s split tunneling tool, it routes only some of your traffic through its private servers, thus preventing bandwidth bottlenecks that might otherwise slow down your connection.

NordVPN is a match for many of Hulu&#8217;s tricks to block users streaming the service outside the U.S. It offers exceptional streaming quality plus unique features such as smart play technology to enhance the viewing experience.

SurfShark has a two-year subscription for $2.49 per month, making it a pocket-friendly VPN. It also provides 30-day money-back guarantees as an added assurance.

The only VPN offering unlimited simultaneous connections on a single account is SurfShark, so you can use it without worrying about multi-login limits. SurfShark is one of the best VPNs for unblocking BBC iPlayer, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, and more.

There are a bunch of positives to SurfShark, which make it a top VPN for Hulu. The company has an extensive server network across the U.S., offers unlimited bandwidth, and is one of the fastest VPN providers.

Hulu&#8217;s free plan is limited to 10GB, which is only enough to watch two HD movies. However, the Pro plan offers unlimited data and unblocks all shows for you.

#### 5] VyprVPN

The VyprVPN provider is back as a leading streaming tool unblocking significant media platforms like Hulu, American Netflix, BBC iPlayer, and more. VyprVPN proves that even a smaller network can be robust when it&#8217;s got solid, reliable connections. It has high-speed servers in 8 US cities and 700+ servers abroad.

To keep your connection fast and steady, this VPN utilizes server clusters and dynamic server switching. If one of the servers you&#8217;re connected to goes down or becomes overcrowded, the VPN automatically switches you to another one in the same area.

VyprVPN was designed to defeat censorship and circumvent geo-restrictions. The Chameleon protocol scrambles OpenVPN metadata, which hides the fact that you&#8217;re using a VPN. Combining regular IP refreshing with this gives us complete freedom to sneak around any VPN detection software on Hulu. Chameleon also helps you avoid throttling and congestion by hiding the fact that you&#8217;re using a VPN from your ISP.

**Features**

  1. Access Hulu with servers in eight major US cities
  2. Dynamic server switching and Chameleon protocol to bypass geo-blocks
  3. Connect up to 30 devices simultaneously
  4. 24/7 live chat and 30-day money-back guarantee
  5. Works with: Hulu, Netflix, Disney+, BBC iPlayer, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+ and BBCiPlayer
  6. Compatible with: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, smart TVs, and some routers

**Pros**

  1. Easy to use

  3. Superfast Chameleon VPN protocol
  4. 30 simultaneous connections
  5. Unlimited bandwidth

**Cons**

  1. Inconsistent speeds across distances
  2. Limited servers, wide network.
  3. Slow connection time.

### <a></a>Can I use a Free VPN to Watch Hulu?

No, you cannot use a free VPN to watch Hulu because they cannot bypass geo-restrictions. Not only that, but they are also not reliable in terms of security and anonymity. A free VPN leaks DNS and IP addresses, and it records user activities.

Moreover, a free VPN will not have enough servers and bandwidth to satisfy your requirements. If your VPN does not provide you with the speed and variety you need for streaming, it is not a good choice. A free VPN will only allow you to bypass Hulu restrictions a few times temporarily. But, with a premium VPN, you can access Hulu within a minute.

### <a></a>Does Hulu block VPNs?

Yes, it does. You cannot access Hulu&#8217;s content outside the United States using proxies or VPNs because Hulu blocks them using geolocation technology. A list of available VPN connections is regularly checked against your IP address. However, if you use the Hulu location trick, all the VPNs on your list will periodically update their IP address to avoid getting detected by Hulu.

### <a></a>Can I use Hulu in two locations?

Yes, you can use Hulu in two locations simultaneously since Hulu allows two simultaneous connections. You can share your Hulu account with your family members as long as no more than two devices are streaming Hulu at the same time.

### <a></a>How can I watch Hulu for free?

If you want to watch shows on Hulu for free, then you can, as Hulu offers a 30-day money-back guarantee to new users who wish to try the service for free. When the trial period expires, all you have to do is cancel the service to avoid being charged for the next month.

I hope this post helped you know the best Hulu VPNs for watching HD videos from anywhere.
