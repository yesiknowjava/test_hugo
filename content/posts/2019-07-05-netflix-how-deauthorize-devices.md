Netflix allows an account to be used on various devices and with multiple profiles. If you have shared your account with friends, but now have a reason not to allow them to use it anymore, you can choose to deauthorize devices in Netflix.<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-184 size-full" title="Deauthorize devices in Netflix" src="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Netflix-Sign-out-of-all-devices.png" alt="Netflix Sign out of all devices" width="600" height="251" srcset="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Netflix-Sign-out-of-all-devices.png 600w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Netflix-Sign-out-of-all-devices-300x126.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> 

### How to deauthorize devices in Netflix

  1. Go to the [Netflix Account Page][1]
  2. Click on Sign Out of All devices
  3. The page will prompt you, &#8220;Are you sure you want to sign out of this Netflix account on all devices?&#8221;
  4. Click on the Sign Out button. Netflix doesn&#8217;t ask one to sign in every time one opens Netflix. It applies to both one using a browser, and the Mobile App. It is possible that you have a 

**new person joining** in the sharing pool or you **need to change the password**. In both cases, you need to make sure that the account is signed out of all those devices. The process will take up to 8 hours to take effect on all devices and affects all profiles in this account. _Note:_ You can follow these steps only using a browser, and not via the mobile app. Even if you open the account settings on the app, it will open in the browser. 

#### Delete Netflix profile & Change password Post this, make sure to 

**delete the [Netflix Profiles][2]** you are planning to remove, and also **change the account password**. Of course, you will need to share the password with the new set of people. I wish there was a way where one could choose to remove individual devices. You can partially do it by deleting the profile, but that&#8217;s only half done. You will still need to change the password to make it useful. Sharing a Netflix account is not uncommon, and so are new people in the Netflix sharing pool. There are a lot of options like Netflix, which offer a similar experience. It is perfectly reasonable for anyone to get bored using Netflix alone.
