One of the advantages of social media is that you can share interesting content with your friends and followers. Facebook gives you the option to share a post, while Twitter provides you the option to retweet. Similarly, Instagram gives you the option to share your friend&#8217;s Instagram stories as your own story. To repost something on Instagram means to share your friend&#8217;s or someone&#8217;s Instagram post to your story. It is an excellent way to share and spread beautiful content with more people. 

### When Can You Share Someone&#8217;s Instagram Post on Your Story? There are two conditions here, and at least one of them must be met. Both accounts on Instagram must be following each other, or the account whose story you want to share is Public

**,** and they have enabled the option of resharing their stories. You cannot repost posts or stories from private Instagram content to your own profile, even if they are following you. If both private accounts follow each other, though, then you can share their Instagram post on your profile. It is important to note that you can only share pictures through this process. It does not apply to audio and video-based stories.

## How to Repost an Instagram Story You Are Not Tagged In You can only repost stories where you are tagged when using the official Instagram App. However, there are other ways. You can take a screenshot or record the story using the built-in recorder of your smartphone. The editing tools will allow you to remove or hide any tagging if you need to get it done. Otherwise, you can always repost the Instagram story without any modification.
