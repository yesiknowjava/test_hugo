The main intention behind this bundling of three services is that you can save up to $5 per month. The basic Hulu plan has ads, though there is a workaround via which you can get Hulu&#8217;s ad-free subscription and Disney+ for in a single bundle.

You will first get to enjoy a 7-day free trial of the service before your subscription begins, and you are charged for it. You can cancel your subscription anytime during the trial period to avoid being charged for it. 

### **Can You Share Your Disney Plus Subscription?** One Disney Plus subscription supports seven user profiles and up to 4 simultaneous 4K streams. What this means is that while one Disney Plus subscription can be shared among seven people, only four can stream content from it at any given time. For a hassle-free experience, it is recommended that you share your Disney Plus subscription with only three other people.
