With more than 500 million people using [Instagram Stories][1] daily, it is essential to make your stories entertaining and worth watching if you want to stand out. Instagram gives you enormous options to make your Story look exciting and entertaining. Among them is the ability to add music to your Instagram Story. In 2018, Instagram introduced its new feature, &#8220;Music Sticker,&#8221; with the help of which you can add any music of your choice and mood to your photos as well as videos. 

## Add Music to Your Instagram Stories

**Step 1**: Tap the Camera icon on the top-left of the Instagram app on your iPhone or Android device. **Step 2:** Take any photo or video of your choice and tap the sticker button among the various other tools given at the top. **Step 3:** Search and select the **&#8220;**Music**&#8220;** sticker, which will directly take you to the Instagram music library. You can either choose your song from the provided library or search by typing the same from the search bar.<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2560 size-large" title="How To Add Music To Your Instagram Story" src="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/add-music-instagram-story-700x485.jpg" alt="add music instagram story" width="696" height="482" srcset="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/add-music-instagram-story-700x485.jpg 700w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/add-music-instagram-story-300x208.jpg 300w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/add-music-instagram-story-768x532.jpg 768w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/add-music-instagram-story-1536x1063.jpg 1536w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/add-music-instagram-story-218x150.jpg 218w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/add-music-instagram-story-696x482.jpg 696w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/add-music-instagram-story-1068x739.jpg 1068w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/add-music-instagram-story-607x420.jpg 607w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/add-music-instagram-story-100x70.jpg 100w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/add-music-instagram-story.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /> **Step 4:** You can play, fast forward, or rewind through the track to choose your favorite part of the song which suits your Story.

You can also hide the lyrics and instead, show the cover album of the song.<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2561 size-large" title="How To Add Music To Your Instagram Story" src="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/configure-instagram-music-story-700x487.jpg" alt="How To Add Music To Your Instagram Story" width="696" height="484" srcset="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/configure-instagram-music-story-700x487.jpg 700w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/configure-instagram-music-story-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/configure-instagram-music-story-768x535.jpg 768w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/configure-instagram-music-story-1536x1070.jpg 1536w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/configure-instagram-music-story-696x485.jpg 696w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/configure-instagram-music-story-1068x744.jpg 1068w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/configure-instagram-music-story-603x420.jpg 603w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/configure-instagram-music-story-100x70.jpg 100w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/configure-instagram-music-story.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /> **Step 5:** Finally, tap the &#8220;Your Story&#8221; button at the bottom of the screen. I hope the post and the steps were easy to follow, and you will now be able to make your Instagram stories much more musical. 

### How to increase Instagram stories&#8217; music duration?

<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2564 size-large" title="How to increase Instagram story music time?" src="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/change-insatgram-music-story-timing-700x490.jpg" alt="change Instagram music story timing" width="696" height="487" srcset="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/change-insatgram-music-story-timing-700x490.jpg 700w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/change-insatgram-music-story-timing-300x210.jpg 300w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/change-insatgram-music-story-timing-768x537.jpg 768w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/change-insatgram-music-story-timing-1536x1074.jpg 1536w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/change-insatgram-music-story-timing-696x487.jpg 696w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/change-insatgram-music-story-timing-1068x747.jpg 1068w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/change-insatgram-music-story-timing-600x420.jpg 600w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/change-insatgram-music-story-timing-100x70.jpg 100w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/change-insatgram-music-story-timing.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /> The default time for Instagram Story Music is 15 seconds. However, if you see it differently, tap on the timer available on the music track&#8217;s left. It will then reveal a selector where you can set Instagram story music to only 5 seconds or anywhere between 5 and 15 seconds. 

### How to send Music on Instagram message? Once you are done adding music to an image or video, you can choose to send music to Instagram as a message. Tap on &#8216;Send to,&#8217; and instead of sharing it on Story, select a contact, and it will be sent as an Instagram message. 

### FAQ: Add Music To Your Instagram Story

**How to add music to the Instagram Stories without the sticker?** As of now, it is not possible to add music to Instagram stories without using stories. **I am unable to add music to Instagram Stories?** It would be best if you used the Music Sticker to add music. If you are unable to find it, make sure to search in the sticker section. Once used, next time, it will be among recently used stickers. The feature is also not available in all regions. **Is the music on Instagram stories gone? Why can&#8217;t I add music to my Instagram stories?** No, it is not gone.  The feature was rolled out a long time ago, and all you need to do is search. Since the implementation is different, it isn&#8217;t evident. **How do you get the music option on Instagram?** Once you select a photo, tap on the add sticker button, and then search for the Music sticker option. **How to add your own music to the Instagram stories?** It is not possible to upload music from your phone and use it in an Instagram story. **How to add music to the Instagram story without lyrics?** Once you have selected the music, swipe to the left to change from lyrics to Album cover.  The last two options will remove the lyrics and instead post info about the music. **Can I use the Music sticker for Instagram posts and not Stories?** You can only use the Music sticker on Instagram to add music to your stories and not posts. This is due to the licensing limitation, and if you upload a post on Instagram with music, it will likely be blocked for copyright reasons.
