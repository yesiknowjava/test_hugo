### <span data-preserver-spaces="true">What are Instagram Reels?</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Instagram Reels went live in August 2020 for the majority of users. Instagram Reels allow you to share 15-30 second videos with others in a new dedicated feed on the Explore page. With Reels, anyone can become a creator on Instagram and reach new audiences worldwide. </span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Instagram says if your Reel is featured on Explore, you&#8217;ll receive a notification.

## <span data-preserver-spaces="true">How to create Instagram Reels?</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Look at the reels of other accounts or brands you like on the Explore page before making your own. Get a sense of what works, what you want, and what inspires you to create. You can access and develop Reels in 3 different ways:</span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">1. The Instagram home screen</span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">2. The Reels tab</span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">3. The Instagram Stories camera</span>

#### Uploading prerecorded videos &#8211;

  * <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tap the gallery icon at the bottom of your screen or swipe up. It&#8217;s important to know that Instagram does not currently support the addition of images to Reels.</span>
  * <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Once you have selected the video, use the trimming tool at the bottom to edit the length. The clip will play repeatedly and, a bar at the top indicates how much of the video time you have left.

  * <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Once you have the desired amount of clips you want to include, click on the </span>Upload<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> button at the top right of your screen.</span>

  * <span data-preserver-spaces="true">You can also use the Reels editor tools while recording to enhance your videos.</span>
  * <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Note that these features are to be selected before you register for the video.</span>

#### Using videos recorded in your app + prerecorded videos together –

  * <span data-preserver-spaces="true">You don&#8217;t have to stick to one method. You can create your Reel using a combination of in-app and prerecorded videos.  </span>
  * <span data-preserver-spaces="true">IG Reels enables you to upload only videos to your gallery, which means you won&#8217;t need to search through the entire image library to find past recordings. To do this, click the </span>Gallery button at the top left of your screen and select the Videos.
