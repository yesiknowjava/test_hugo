</div> The company had made this basic case using feather-light five-layer protection features. It has a shock-resistant core and polycarbonate shear plate, including top leather and alloy metal. All this makes this case a perfect candidate for adding protection to the iPhone. It comes with a signature Armor frame that enhances the style of the cover and ultra-responsive button, which makes it ideal for use on iPhone 12. Overall, this cover is excellent for strengthening the protection and keeping the screen covered. 

**Bottom Line** These are some of the best iPhone 12 cases that you can buy in India to protect your iPhone. The covers are made with highly-resistant materials and help to keep the screen protected. In our opinion, Urban Armor gear basic case, X Doria back cover, and Spigen Tough Armor TPU is best to buy. These only cost you less than Rs 4000 and are extremely worthier to have for iPhone 12. 

### How Can I Clean the Different iPhone 12 Cases and Covers? If you want to clean the cases deep, first make sure you take the case out without damaging the phone. Some cases are too tight after they fit in, and too much force can break the phone or the case. Once it is out, first clean with a soft cloth to remove dust, then take a light-damp cloth, and clean it again. Leave the case for some time to dry, and then put it back again. 

### Why Do Some iPhone 12 Cases Have a Circle? iPhone 12 supports wireless charging through MagSafe. It allows charging accessories to attach to the magnet to charge. That is why some of the cases for iPhone 12 have a circle which helps in identifying the case as a MagSafe compatible case. While not necessary, some case makers add it to attract eyeballs.
