## How to Send WhatsApp Messages to Unsaved Numbers

WhatsApp has existed for ten years now, and we still communicate with our contacts through the messaging app. It is possible to message someone if you save their contact information to your phone&#8217;s contact list, wait for the app to sync so that their name appears inside WhatsApp, and then start a conversation. If the contacts aren&#8217;t synced quickly, this can take several minutes or even hours.

A few tricks can help you bypass this ridiculous restriction and chat with a new contact immediately. Follow these steps to message an unknown number on your desktop:

  * Click on the **Chrome browser** and create a new tab with **wa.me/the\_number\_with_country-code**
  * A window will appear with the option to **start a** **conversation** **>** Tap on the **CONTINUE TO CHAT.**
  * From now on, you can send a message to that number without saving it.

That&#8217;s all you need to do.

### Send WhatsApp Messages to Unknown Numbers Through Apps

You can also use the following apps available to send messages to unsaved numbers:

  1. WA Dialer App
  2. Easy Message: Text without saving the phone number

Let&#8217;s try these out and see if it fixes our problem.

#### 1] WA Dialer App
