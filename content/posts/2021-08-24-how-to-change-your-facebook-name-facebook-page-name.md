## <a></a>What Do You Need to Do to Change your Facebook&#8217;s Page Name?

It will help if you keep certain things in mind before starting the name-changing process. You won&#8217;t change your Facebook name if you don&#8217;t do it the right way. So, read the following recommendations carefully:

  1. You must be the admin of the Page that you wish to rename.
  2. You should carefully consider the name of your new Page. If you have chosen the correct name, spell it carefully and see if it is the one you want. When you misspell your name or change your mind right after requesting a change, Facebook won&#8217;t allow you to change it again.
  3. A Facebook page name can consist of up to 75 characters, but this should be more than enough for a short and simple name. There is plenty of space in the _About section_ to add or describe anything else you wish.
  4. You can&#8217;t name your page _official_ unless it&#8217;s the official Page for a place, brand, public figure, or organisation.
  5. Furthermore, it must not contain any abusive terms or violate anyone&#8217;s rights.
  6. It cannot be capital letters, generic words like _coffee_, or geographical locations like _London_.
  7. There cannot be any wrong capitalisation.
  8. There should be no unnecessary punctuation, symbols, slogans, descriptions in the page title section.
  9. Variations of _Facebook_ itself are banned.

### Why Can&#8217;t I Change the Name of My Facebook page?

Facebook can sometimes prevent you from changing the name of your Page. There may be several reasons for this:

<div class="wp-block-image">
  <figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="700" height="376" src="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/change-your-facebook-page-name.png" alt="How to Change your Facebook Name + Facebook Page Name" class="wp-image-9497" srcset="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/change-your-facebook-page-name.png 700w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/change-your-facebook-page-name-300x161.png 300w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/change-your-facebook-page-name-696x374.png 696w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></figure>
</div>

  1. You are not an administrator of the Facebook page you want to rename.
  2. You&#8217;ve changed your page name recently.
  3. Your page name was renamed recently by another administrator.
  4. There are limits imposed on your Page — if you, or another admin, don&#8217;t have an authentic profile and violate Facebook&#8217;s policies; if your page title or content is misleading; if the content violates Facebook&#8217;s hate speech policies.
  5. The Page you have is regional and falls under a global page.

### <a></a>Can I Change the Name of My Facebook Page Frequently?

The admins of Facebook pages are usually allowed to change their page names once a week. The consequence is that if you misspelled the new name or changed your mind about it, you&#8217;ll be unable to change it again for another week. Changing your page name too often may cause Facebook to regard your Page as spammy. Make sure the name you are choosing is appropriate for the content you post, and then make the change once you are confident.

### <a></a>How Do I Change my Page URL on Facebook?

Changing the name doesn&#8217;t change the web URL. Although Facebook did not allow changing page URLs or usernames in the past, you can do so quickly in 2019 if you&#8217;re an admin. Follow these steps to update your Facebook username and URL:

  1. Go to your **Facebook Page**
  2. Click on **About** on the left side of the Page.
  3. Click on the **Edit** option on the right side of your Username.
  4. Type in the new **Username>** Click on **Create Username.**

As you may have noticed, the URL of your Page has also changed.

### <a></a>How Does It Work When People Search for Your Page by Its Old Name?

Even if you already have a large following on Facebook, you might still want to keep them informed about your Page when they search for it.

Whenever you successfully change the name of your Facebook Page, the old name still appears in the search results when people search for it by the old name. People will notice the new name of your Page, however, when they visit it.

If enough time passes, Facebook may eventually include the new name in search results under the old name. Accordingly, changing your Facebook Page name doesn&#8217;t affect the searchability it has for existing followers.

### <a></a>Why Would My Facebook Page Have Limits Imposed?

Several reasons might cause your Facebook page to have limits:

  * Some of the admins of your Page do not have genuine profiles.
  * Admins on your Page continue to violate Facebook policies.
  * Your Page has a misleading name.
  * People who follow or like your Page might be misled by the content you post.
  * There is hate speech content on your Page, which is against Facebook&#8217;s policies.

### <a></a>How to Change your Facebook Username

Sometimes when you grow your business, you need to make adjustments, including a username change. To change your Page username, you need to follow these steps:

  * Below the **Name field**, type a unique username that reflects your Page&#8217;s name in the **Username** field.
  * Click on any blank space on the web app and wait for Facebook to apply the new change.

Facebook does not require approval when changing the Username of a Page.

I hope this post will help you know how to change your Facebook Name and Facebook Page Name.
