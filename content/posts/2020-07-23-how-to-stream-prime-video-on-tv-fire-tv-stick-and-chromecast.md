Most Android Phone comes with a Cast option, i.e., it allows you to mirror your phone&#8217;s content to TV or Chromecast, or any DLNA device. However, streaming services should be supported by the application. This post will share how you can stream Prime Video on Fire TV Stick, Chromecast, and DLNA devices. 

## How to stream Prime Video on TV, Fire TV Stick, and Chromecast Prime Videos App did not launch with this feature earlier, but now the app supports this feature. However, it is not as straightforward as Netflix. While you cannot mirror the whole app, you can stream any video. 

  1. Launch the Prime Video App and navigate to the video you want to stream.
  2. Tap to open, and then click on Watch On option. If you cannot see the Watch On option, click on the three vertical dot menu, and it will reveal the Watch on Option.
  3. Tap on it, and it will reveal the available devices on which you can stream the video.
  4. Tap on the device, and it will start streaming.

You can view the cast using the X-ray feature of Prime Videos, Jump to scenes, learn more about characters, and so on. Apart from this, you have the option to pause, forward, stop, and switch episodes on the go.<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2773 size-large" title="How to stream Prime Video on TV, Fire TV Stick, and Chromecast" src="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Xray-Prime-Video-700x765.jpg" alt="Xray Prime Video" width="700" height="765" srcset="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Xray-Prime-Video-700x765.jpg 700w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Xray-Prime-Video-275x300.jpg 275w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Xray-Prime-Video-768x839.jpg 768w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Xray-Prime-Video-1406x1536.jpg 1406w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Xray-Prime-Video-1875x2048.jpg 1875w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Xray-Prime-Video-696x760.jpg 696w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Xray-Prime-Video-1068x1166.jpg 1068w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Xray-Prime-Video-385x420.jpg 385w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Xray-Prime-Video.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /> I find this a lot better than Netflix streaming options, where only get options to control video playback, manage subtitles, and so on. 

### Managing Casting Quality and Data Usage You can also configure Cast Data Usage to save bandwidth. Under the Stream and Download section of your profile, you can set data usage between Balance, Unlimited, and Data Saver. However, it is applicable for Chromecast only.

### How to download the video for the best streaming experience Make sure to download 

[Prime Video Series and Movies][1] in high quality using a WiFi network on your phone. When you stream to those devices, your phone&#8217;s internet will not be used and will work even without an internet connection. If your regular internet is not working as expected to stream HD video, [you can try using VPN, giving an increased boost][2] and letting you watch blocked content anytime. I hope the post was easy to follow, and you were able to download or stream the Prime Video HD content to your Smart TV or Chromecast device. It goes without saying that streaming from phone to other device needs a stable and good performingÂ  Wifi network. Make sure you have it.
