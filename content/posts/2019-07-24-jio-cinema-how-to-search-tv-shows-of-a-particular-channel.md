## Jio Cinema: How to search TV shows of a particular channel on Jio Cinema

  2. Keep scrolling down till you find the Channels section. Click on See All to view all of them.

If you do not want to watch it right away, you can choose to add it to My List or start downloading it. Scroll down a little, and you should see all the episodes of the show. You can play or add to the list or [download any of them][1]. The problem with this approach is that there is no search option available when you are on TV shows of a particular channel. Scrolling down to find them takes a lot of time. So if you find them confusing, you can directly search by Show name which is a lot easier. It will list down the TV shows or episodes, and then you can directly take the appropriate action. While the [Jio Cinema][2] interface works, it still is not very easy to find content. Bits and pieces are missing in the interface, especially when it comes to upcoming movies, the option to turn off instant playback, and more. There is no option to download all episodes in one go. _We hope our tip to search TV shows of a particular channel on Jio Cinema helped you.Â _
