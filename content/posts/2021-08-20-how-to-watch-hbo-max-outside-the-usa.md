Are you looking for a method of watching HBO Max outside the United States of America? In this guide, I will provide you with easy steps to watch HBO Max outside the USA.

HBO Max is an American streaming service that launched in May 2020. This new streaming service offers original programming from some of the biggest production companies and networks, such as Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Studio Ghibli, Looney Tunes, Warner Bros and CNN, and HBO shows like Game of Thrones.

However, there&#8217;s a downside! Unlike other HBO services, HBO Max is only available in the United States due to geo-blocking policies. In that case, if you try to access HBO Max outside the USA, you will see the following geo-blocking error: _HBO Max is not available in your region._ However, a VPN is a great way to ensure that you don&#8217;t have to go anywhere to get HBO Max.

### Why Use a VPN to Access HBO Max?

Have you ever imagined how these services know where you are? Well, most websites find your location from your IP address, but when you connect to a VPN, websites can only see the IP address of the server you&#8217;re using. In this situation, HBO Max will believe you&#8217;re in the US and allow you to use the service.

There are plenty of other reasons to [use a VPN beyond streaming][1]. In addition, they encrypt your internet traffic so that your employer, ISP, or other snoopers cannot see what you do on the internet. Moreover, if you live in a country with strict online censorship, you can even bypass a VPN&#8217;s restrictions.

## <a></a>How to Watch HBO Max Outside the USA

To watch HBO Max&#8217;s great TV shows and movies, subscribers must be in the USA. If you&#8217;re not, they&#8217;ll deliver an alternative message or redirect you to a location-appropriate page.

The most common way to access blocked TV in other countries is to use a VPN or Smart DNS service. You&#8217;ll need one of those, or something similar, to watch HBO Max.

To watch HBO max online abroad using a VPN, follow these steps:

  * Begin by signing up for a VPN.
  * Ensure you have the correct VPN app installed on your device.
  * [Connect to a VPN server][2] in the appropriate location (you&#8217;ll need an American VPN server).
  * Now, create an account on HBO Max&#8217;s website. For this to work, you&#8217;ll need a credit or debit card associated with an American address.
  * Lastly, try playing a video. You should see the page load immediately, but clear your cookies and try again if it doesn&#8217;t.
