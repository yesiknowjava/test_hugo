Do you ever wish that you could save videos from the websites you use regularly? This guide will tell you how to download Facebook/Twitter/Instagram/Snapchat videos quickly.

Video sharing is one of the main reasons people keep coming back to social media sites. Perhaps you&#8217;d like to download a video from Twitter or a picture from Instagram or Facebook. But, it&#8217;s not in the social network&#8217;s interest to let you download videos to watch elsewhere. However, you can save Instagram and other social network videos with third-party tools that don&#8217;t have the download button.

Although the website has a _Save video_ button next to clips, it does nothing more than adding the video to your saved video bookmarks for later viewing on the website. The problem comes in when you want to share personal videos with friends or family who do not have a social media account or when you want to watch a video offline. 

There are many good tools for downloading videos from Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, or Twitter through web apps, which means you don&#8217;t need to download any programs. It takes just a couple of clicks to save a video (some even let you convert it to an audio file format) by copying the link and pasting it into the video downloader website.
