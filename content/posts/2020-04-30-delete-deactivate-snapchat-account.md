Snapchat is great for sharing ephemeral photos and videos with your friends, family, and the world. Many people tend to prefer Snapchat over Facebook and Instagram because of its casual nature and the excellent AR filters it offers. However, if you have been sucked down the Snapchat rabbit hole and are looking to delete or deactivate your Snapchat account, follow this guide. Deleting your Snapchat account is a two-step process. The account is first deactivated and then removed from the server after a few days. This gives the user time to reactivate their account if they change their mind or if the deletion wasn&#8217;t the intention. However, once the account is permanently deleted, there&#8217;s no way for you to reactivate your account. Before you delete your Snapchat account though, make sure to download all your data from the platform. 

### How to Download Snapchat Data before Deleting Your Account It is always recommended to download your data before deleting your Snapchat account. The data will include the following: 

  * Login History
  * Account Information
  * Profile data
  * Snap History
  * Location
  * Overview of your friends
  * Search History Follow the below-mentioned steps to download the data: 

**Step 1:** Enter your login details after visiting the Snapchat&#8217;s Account website. **Step 2:** Click **My Data** and then select **Submit Request.** **Step 3:** You will receive a link in your mail when your data is ready to be downloaded. Follow the said link. **Point to remember:** You will not be able to download your Snapchat data immediately after making the request. Snapchat says it can take up to 30 days depending on the amount of data associated with your account. If you do not care about your Snapchat data and do not wish to wait though, you can go ahead and proceed to delete your account.<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2216" src="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/snapchat-iphone-scaled.jpg" alt="Snapchat on iPhone" width="590" height="393" srcset="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/snapchat-iphone-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/snapchat-iphone-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/snapchat-iphone-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/snapchat-iphone-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/snapchat-iphone-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/snapchat-iphone-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/snapchat-iphone-696x464.jpg 696w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/snapchat-iphone-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/snapchat-iphone-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" />
