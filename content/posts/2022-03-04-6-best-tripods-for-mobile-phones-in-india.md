_How about gifting a sturdy Tripod to your vlogger friend?_ Of course, a camera will be too high on a budget so a Tripod Stand will be the ideal birthday gift. This Tygot Gorilla Tripod is made up of superior quality ABS material. It makes the Tygot solid and durable compared to the Tripod made of ordinary plastic or any other material. The most significant advantage is that it doesn&#8217;t matter if you don&#8217;t handle it well like this happens when you shoot outdoors; your device and Tripod will be safe. Moreover, it is used not only with Phones but also with cameras and DSLRs. The Tripod Stand contains an anodized finished rotating sphere that&#8217;s perfect if your device is heavier. It&#8217;s a mini Tripod measuring 13 inches in length. Its stand has a clasped lock having fail-proof technology. That makes it easy to take care that your phone does not lose its inclined perfect angle while shooting. The mini Tripod has a universal screw that measures ¼ inches, which keeps the mount in place. Moreover, the Gorillapod&#8217;s legs don&#8217;t slip and have steady legs. The Tripod&#8217;s 360-degree rotation ensures that you get the perfect flexibility while shooting without any interruptions. The Tripod is portable to carry anywhere you desire. When you go camping, hiking, or any other location, you can conveniently take it with you. **Pros:** 

  * Designed for adventurous paths
  * Value For Money
  * Flexible Legs

**Cons:** 

  * It is not anti-slippery

_Do you want a mobile tripod that&#8217;s easy to handle?_ If yes, then AmazonBasics has the right product for you! Therefore, the stand is straightforward to set up and handle. It is a lightweight tripod stand usually for mobiles but can carry cameras weighing 6.6 pounds. But for optimum performance, it is recommended to load it with a maximum weight of 3 kg. The Tripod&#8217;s legs can be adjusted from 20&#8243; to 48&#8243; per your needs. For getting the required height, you can release its leg locks. Moreover, the leg locks are smoother to remove.

It also has the top camera plate to ensure whether your device is balanced or not. Its adjustable rubber feet are beneficial to get the desired position. Be it your smartphone, video camera, digital camera, still camera, or any GoPro device. It is compatible with most devices. With its 3-way head, you can rotate it seamlessly when required and get the perfect clicks. The Tripod has a quick-release mounting plate that helps you to get faster transitions between all your clicks. **Pros:**
