Many people are very private and particular about their visibility on WhatsApp**,** and thus they are not very comfortable in sharing their &#8216;last seen&#8217; status with everyone. Also, WhatsApp has read receipts &#8212; a blue tick &#8212; which will let one know when you have read their message. In this post, we will share how you can hide your Last Seen on WhatsApp. We have also included the trick to disable the blue tick. 

## **How to Hide Last Seen on WhatsApp** If you do not want to show your last seen status on WhatsApp, these are the steps that you need to follow: 

  1. Open WhatsApp and tap the three-dot menu button at the top right corner.
  2. Select **Settings** from the menu that opens. Tap on **Account** followed by the **Privacy** setting.<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1516 size-large" title="How to Hide 'Last Seen' and Read Receipts on WhatsApp" src="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Disable-Last-Seen-Status-WhatsApp-600x463.png" alt="How to Hide 'Last Seen' and Read Receipts on WhatsApp" width="600" height="463" srcset="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Disable-Last-Seen-Status-WhatsApp-600x463.png 600w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Disable-Last-Seen-Status-WhatsApp-300x231.png 300w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Disable-Last-Seen-Status-WhatsApp-768x592.png 768w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Disable-Last-Seen-Status-WhatsApp-1536x1185.png 1536w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Disable-Last-Seen-Status-WhatsApp-696x537.png 696w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Disable-Last-Seen-Status-WhatsApp-1068x824.png 1068w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Disable-Last-Seen-Status-WhatsApp-545x420.png 545w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Disable-Last-Seen-Status-WhatsApp.png 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> 
  3. Select **Last Seen** from the list and then choose **Nobody**Â from the list. Once you have changed the settings to 

**Nobody**, no one will be able to see your last online status on WhatsApp **Disadvantages of Hiding Last Seen Status on WhatsApp** One of the disadvantages of disabling Last Seen on WhatsApp is that you will also **not be able to see the last online status** of others as well**.** It is a fair trade-off though if you are keen to know when your friends were last online on WhatsApp, it is pertinent your last online status is visible as well. There is another disadvantage to this feature. WhatsApp momentarily shows your status as online when you open the conversation with that person. However, this will only be visible when that person has your conversation already open. 

## **How to Disable Read Receipts/Blue Tick in WhatsApp** Hiding Last Seen doesn&#8217;t disable read receipts. Any message that you read will still have a blue tick that will inform the recipient that you have read the message (grey ticks will change to blue ticks), along with the time. To disable, here is what you need to do: 

  1. Open WhatsApp and tap the three-dot overflow menu button on the top right corner.
  2. Tap on **Settings** from the menu that opens.
  3. Then tap on **Account** -> **Privacy**.
  4. Toggle off the **Read receipts** option.

I hope the post was easy to follow, and you were able to hide your last seen status and also disable the read receipts feature in WhatsApp. If you are still facing any issues, drop a comment, and let us know!
