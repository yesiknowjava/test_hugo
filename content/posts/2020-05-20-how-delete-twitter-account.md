There is no doubt that Twitter is one of the most used and helpful platforms out there via which you can stay up to date with the latest news, interact with like-minded people, and more. But, it can also turn out to be the best platform for trolls to spew hatred. If you are frustrated with Twitter due to some reason or the other and want to get rid of it for good, you can delete your Twitter account or just deactivate it temporarily. Twitter only offers the option to deactivate one&#8217;s account. However, it has been implemented in such a manner that it can be used to temporarily disable or permanently delete your account. 

### **What to Know Before Deactivating your Twitter account**

  * If you want to change your username or email address, you can simply do it using the Account Settings. You do not need to deactivate your account for the same.
  * If you are planning to use your existing Twitter handle or email address on some other account, you are first required to change them and then confirm the change before deactivating your Twitter account.
  * Twitter does not control the content indexed by any of the search engines; for example, Google or Bing.
  * If you deactivate your Twitter account, your display name, username as well as your public profile will no longer be viewable on Twitter.com, Twitter for Android and Twitter for iOS.
  * The good thing is if your mind changes within 30 days, you even have the option to retrieve your deleted Twitter account. However, after this time period passes, Twitter will start purging all your data from its system. The moment it is done, your account will be deleted forever.
