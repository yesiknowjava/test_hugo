#### **Which Power Bank You Should Pick Up?** Power banks these days become crucial while traveling and going outdoors. The device can quickly charge your phones without worrying about the electricity supply. Now, you have the list of the six best 10000 mAh power banks that are worth buying. However, in our opinion, Realme 10,000mAh power bank and Mi Pocket Power Bank Pro Black 10000mAh. Both these power banks are portable and cost you less than Rs 2000, so it would be an excellent investment to have one. 

### How Much Can a 10000 Power Bank Charge? It will depend on which device you are charging. If your phone packs in 5000 mAh, you should be able to charge it about twice. If you have connected two devices while charging, it will drain faster and charge the devices at a slower rate. 

### Which Power Bank Is Best for Fast Charging? The list of Fast Charging battery packs includes: 

  * MI POWER BANK 3I.
  * MI WIRELESS POWER BANK
  * MI POCKET POWER BANK.
  * REALME 20000 MAH POWER BANK. However, most of them will be limited to 18W fast charging. It means the power bank will not charge at the same speed as your wall charger.
