WhatsApp has offered voice and video calls through its iPhone and Android apps for years, but now the feature is also available on its desktop app. WhatsApp&#8217;s voice and video calls are end-to-end encrypted. Unfortunately, the desktop does not support group calls for the time being. 

### How to Download WhatsApp on Desktop Before you start, this feature doesn&#8217;t work on the WhatsApp web app. The function is only available in the WhatsApp desktop app. Therefore, you will need to download the desktop app first. They offer similar features such as 

[WhatsApp Status][1], sending messages, Bbuetick support, and more. There are two ways in which you can download the app on your desktop: 

  1. Open your browser, and go to [**web.whatsapp.com.**][2] Log in with your phone by scanning the _QR code_. You will then see WhatsApp available for Windows. Tap on _Get it here_ to download the app.
  2. Go to **whatsapp.com** and, from the homepage, click on the **Mac or Windows PC** button to download it. The WhatsApp calling feature only supports 

_Windows 10 64-bit version 1903 or newer_ and _macOS 10.13 or newer._<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-8126 size-large" title="How to Make WhatsApp Video Calls and Voice Calls from Desktop App" src="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Make-WhatsApp-Voice-Video-Calls-Desktop-700x394.png" alt="How to Make WhatsApp Video Calls and Voice Calls from Desktop App" width="696" height="392" srcset="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Make-WhatsApp-Voice-Video-Calls-Desktop-700x394.png 700w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Make-WhatsApp-Voice-Video-Calls-Desktop-300x169.png 300w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Make-WhatsApp-Voice-Video-Calls-Desktop-768x432.png 768w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Make-WhatsApp-Voice-Video-Calls-Desktop-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Make-WhatsApp-Voice-Video-Calls-Desktop-696x392.png 696w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Make-WhatsApp-Voice-Video-Calls-Desktop-1068x601.png 1068w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Make-WhatsApp-Voice-Video-Calls-Desktop-747x420.png 747w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Make-WhatsApp-Voice-Video-Calls-Desktop.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" />
