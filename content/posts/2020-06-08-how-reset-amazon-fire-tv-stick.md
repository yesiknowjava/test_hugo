It is because the streaming stick breathes a new lease of life in any old non-Smart TV, and in many cases, the Fire TV and TV Stick offer a better experience than many Smart TVs. While Fire TV works flawlessly, it is possible that one fine day it will start acting a bit wonky, thereby forcing you to reset it. There can be many other reasons why you might want to reset your Fire TV or Fire TV Stick. You might be giving it away to a friend, or your unit has just started acting a bit weirdly or crashing randomly. Sadly, while using the Fire TV is easy, the process of resetting it is not that simple. Before you get around to resetting your Fire TV, though, there are a few things you need to know.
