When it comes to choosing the perfect VPN, there are plenty of factors to consider. In this guide, I will tell you the 10 best VPNs for streaming. VPNs protect our privacy as we browse the web because Internet services usually collect all our details. Our data is at risk every time we connect to a free public WiFi hotspot. A free VPN software is a better option than a proxy service if you are passionate about your privacy online. A VPN software gives you safe, encrypted access to the internet, regardless of whether the connection is over your home or work network. 

## What is a VPN?

_A Virtual Private Network (VPN)_ acts as a middleman between your device and the network it is connected to, protecting your private information as you transfer it from one place to another and ensuring no one can see what you&#8217;re doing online. You can access remote desktops, file and folder sharing, and more with a Virtual Private Network, which securely connects your PC to multiple locations throughout the world. However, while a VPN does not completely conceal your online identity or make your connections anonymous, it can be a good way to secure and protect your online connections. 

### Why is VPN Important For Streaming?

[Netflix and other video streaming][1] sites block content based on _geolocation_. The company doesn&#8217;t want you to watch movies that aren&#8217;t licensed in your country; therefore, they identify your _IP address_ and block content that isn&#8217;t legal. If you want to avoid being subject to these unfair practices, you can use a VPN to _mask your real IP address_ and unlock access to content that comes from other countries. 

### 10 Best VPN For Streaming VPNs are software that gives you access to a VPN network for free, as well as the necessary software. Here are some of the best VPN services that see excellent results across the board in terms of security, streaming, and speed, as well as torrenting and gaming.
