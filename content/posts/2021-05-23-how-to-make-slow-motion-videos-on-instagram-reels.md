[Reels videos][1]. Its best quality is that it is integrated with the audio. Reels allows you to choose music from their vast library.

### How to record only part of a video in slow-motion? Another exciting feature that Instagram has is it can record only a part of a video you want to slow down.

In this way, you can record a clip faster and all other clips at an average speed rate of 1x. Your video will only play at a sluggish speed for a portion of it, while the rest will play smoothly. This way, you can slow down your video and create unique and creative reels. I hope this guide will help you know how to make a 

_Slow-Motion video on Instagram Reels._
