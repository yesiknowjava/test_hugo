There is no doubt in the fact that in today’s world Facebook is one of the most popular and preferable social networking platforms.

**STEP 3. Delete or disable your Facebook app from the phone** Sometimes, the Facebook app is pre-installed on your phone. All you need to do is go to your phone’s settings and disable the application. You can always long-press the Facebook App icon, and then choose to uninstall it.

### Steps to Deactivate your Facebook account temporarily If you want to skip Facebook for some time, then deactivating is a better option.

  * Tap the three lines at the top right corner.
  * Navigate to **Settings** **and Privacy** > **Settings > Ac****count Ownership and Control**

### Difference between deleting and deactivating Facebook Account Many people have this confusion or misconception that both the concepts of deleting and disabling your Facebook account are the same. But apparently, that is not the case. Following are the fundamental difference between the two:- 

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="295">
      <strong><u>Deactivating your account</u></strong>
    </td>
    
    <td width="295">
      <strong><u>Deleting your account</u></strong>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td width="295">
      One can re-activate the account as per the choice
    </td>
    
    <td width="295">
      Once removed, the account cannot be re-activated
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td width="295">
      When you deactivate your account, people are unable to either search you or see your timeline
    </td>
    
    <td width="295">
      When you put a request to delete your account, but in the meanwhile, you log in to your account, the request will be canceled automatically. It means people can easily search for you.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td width="295">
      Some information, such as messages sent by you is visible to others during this period.
    </td>
    
    <td width="295">
      Even when the account is deleted, friends can still have access to the messages sent by you.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td width="295">
      Group admin/friends can still be able to see your comments, posts along with your name.
    </td>
    
    <td width="295">
      Once your account is deleted, these things are not possible.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table> &nbsp; I hope the post was easy to follow, and you were able to delete or deactivate the Facebook account from mobile or computer.
