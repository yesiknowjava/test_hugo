**Conclusion** These are the products you can look up in Best Earbuds Under 5000. It is easy for you to choose the one you prefer based on your requirements and budget. Do you want to add a splash of color to your wireless earbuds collection? In that case, going for Noise Shots Neo 2 Wireless Earbuds makes sense. If you have a limited budget and do not want to compromise with the sound quality, you can choose Oppo Enco Buds True Wireless Earbuds. If attaining an exceptional listening experience is your goal, opt for the JBL C115 TWS wireless buds. 

### How Do You Choose Earbud Size? All earbuds offer three sizes—S, M, and L. If you have already used an earbud earlier, you already know your size. If it&#8217;s the first time, try all of them, and use them for 15-20 minutes. If the earbuds come out of the ears too easily, you need to check the next big size. If they are too tight, you need to pick a smaller one. 

### Why Do My Ears Get Wet When I Wear Earbuds? It is an annoying issue with people who sweat a lot, and the only way out is to use a soft cloth to clean it off. However, if that&#8217;s not the problem with you, then it&#8217;s the earbuds at fault. The material used for earbuds is not absorbing the sweat properly. In that case, you will need to change the earbud. Ensure getting feedback about the sweat issue for new earbuds.
