  The ice maker in your refrigerator is an essential part of keeping your drinks cold, but it can also be a significant source of frustration. Maybe you’ve been away on a trip and can’t wait for your ice maker to catch up, or you’ve been making the same old ice cubes for so long that you’ve stopped noticing how much time it’s taking. Either way, the joy of having an electric ice maker at home is hard to overstate. You can make ice as much or as little as you want when you want it; the ice maker will still keep your drinks cool and refreshing no matter when you serve them.

<p style="text-align: justify">
  You probably love the convenience of ice cubes in your drinks. The ice maker in your refrigerator probably keeps your ice supply nicely stocked. But did you ever think about all the ice makers in homes and businesses that extract ice from water and produce it without any energy or pollution? Electric ice makers have ice without any pollution, and in most cases, without any energy cost to run them.
