The TV is 6.9mm thick, which is thinner than most smartphones. Its TV has an aluminum chassis, so you need not worry about its durability. If you are the one who&#8217;s usually excited about the number of ports you have, then there are enough. Whether you want to connect your DTH, your smartphone, your headphones, your gaming device, or install a music system if you&#8217;re going to, you have ports for all of these. It has an inbuilt stand that lets you mount the television on a tabletop. Be it display or sound, you need not compromise. Whenever other television sets exclusive low-quality content into a higher resolution, it does not affect its display quality.

So, you will not need to compromise for picture quality if the content is low picture quality. Its speakers provide high-quality sound and have a powerful bass.
