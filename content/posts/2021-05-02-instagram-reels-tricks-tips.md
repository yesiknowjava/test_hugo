<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-7579 size-full" title="Instagram Reels Tips and Tricks" src="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Instagram-Reels-Effect-Audio-Option.png" alt="Instagram Reels Effect Audio Option" width="700" height="396" srcset="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Instagram-Reels-Effect-Audio-Option.png 700w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Instagram-Reels-Effect-Audio-Option-300x170.png 300w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Instagram-Reels-Effect-Audio-Option-696x394.png 696w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /> Music is undoubtedly one of the core elements of any good reel. It grabs the attention of the audience. Instagram is offering a great collection of music clips to choose from. Start by clicking the music icon to access the audio editor. Now browse your music from hundreds of music clips neatly categorized in the browse menu. Once youâ€™ve picked your song, drag your finger along the audio trimmer at the bottom of your screen and use the audio editor to pick the portion you want to be featured in your recording. 

### 2] Make a text appear and disappear Having fun with texts is another cool trick. You can select a proper duration for how long you want your text to appear and disappear. Here&#8217;s how you do it: 

  * Select the text box above the video preview
  * Please select the part of the video when you want it to appear and disappear. Enjoy seeing your creative text on your reels.= 

### 3] Set a timer for video

<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-7582 size-full" title="Instagram Reels Tips and Tricks" src="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Set-timer-for-video-in-instagram-reels.png" alt="Set timer for video in Instagram reels" width="700" height="396" srcset="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Set-timer-for-video-in-instagram-reels.png 700w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Set-timer-for-video-in-instagram-reels-300x170.png 300w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Set-timer-for-video-in-instagram-reels-696x394.png 696w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /> Another feature that reels come with is that it allows you to set a timer for video. By default, Instagram reels allow you to create a 15-second video. But it&#8217;s not necessary to do so. You can also create a 5-10 seconds video. _To set up your Timer:_ 

  * Press on the _Timer_ button
  * Please select how long your clip will be (it can be up to 15 seconds)
  * A countdown will appear before the recording starts Now you can record your video according to your time. 

### 4] Play with effects

<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-7578 size-full" title="Instagram Reels Tips and Tricks" src="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Instagram-Reels-Effect-AR-Effects-Option.png" alt="Instagram Reels Effect AR Effects Option" width="700" height="396" srcset="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Instagram-Reels-Effect-AR-Effects-Option.png 700w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Instagram-Reels-Effect-AR-Effects-Option-300x170.png 300w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Instagram-Reels-Effect-AR-Effects-Option-696x394.png 696w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /> So far, you have set your video with music and a timer, but what makes your reels look super cool? Effects. Effects are the heart experience of Instagram reels you can add according to your moods like green lights, party lights, funny and sad faces, etc. Tap the _Effects icon_ in the reels menu and scroll through many effects to make that perfect reel video. Following are some of the interesting effects: **Zoom in and Out Effect** Did you know you can zoom in and out when you record your video? You can do it by holding your finger on the record button and sliding it up and down your screen. **Glow Skin Effect** The Glow Skin effect helps you to add an AR filter to your photo or video. It changes the color and contrast of your photo and makes your skin glow. Effects are something that will make your video stand out, so take your time in this. 

### 5] Make slow or fast motion videos on Instagram

<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7581" src="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Make-slow-or-fast-motion-videos-on-Instagram.png" alt="Make slow or fast motion videos on Instagram" width="700" height="394" srcset="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Make-slow-or-fast-motion-videos-on-Instagram.png 700w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Make-slow-or-fast-motion-videos-on-Instagram-300x169.png 300w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Make-slow-or-fast-motion-videos-on-Instagram-696x392.png 696w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /> Instagram gives you the option of choosing your video&#8217;s speed settings. You can quicken things or slow them down. It ranges from slow (.3x speed) to fast (3x speed). From the Reels, the screen slows down the video by 5x and speeds up the video by 3x. You can&#8217;t slow down everything in your video, only do so when something uniquely cool can be enhanced when you slow it down. The slow-mo feature makes your video more eye-catching for the audience. It also offers a lot of opportunities to be creative. 

### 6] Align captured videos Instagram also allows you to adjust the video to make it look stable. If your captured video comes out to be shaky or blurry, you can straighten it using the align feature. If you want to stitch together multiple video clips of one subject in a reel, then this is what you are looking for. This feature will overlay the final frame of your previous clip so that you can align the one you are recording for clean continuity. This is the fifth option in the reels bar after taking a video. Just tap on it and make your video accordingly. 

### 7] Spice your Instagram Reels with stickers and text Instagram allows you to add stickers, doodles on your video, emojis, and texts before sharing your first Reel with the world. When you upload your first video to Instagram, be sure to include things like the time, date, location, right emoji, etc. It makes your video even more appealing. To do this, you need to tap on one of these options on the top and add stickers, emojis, and texts as per your need. It is one of the ways to unleash your creativity. 

### 8] Change cover before sharing the reels

<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-7577 size-full" title="change cover before sharing the reels" src="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/change-cover-before-sharing-the-reels.png" alt="change cover before sharing the reels" width="700" height="396" srcset="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/change-cover-before-sharing-the-reels.png 700w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/change-cover-before-sharing-the-reels-300x170.png 300w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/change-cover-before-sharing-the-reels-696x394.png 696w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /> The cover is the **thumbnail** of your post. Adding a nice cover with an image and headline sums up the value of the post. It attracts people to tap your post to view. _Click on the image to change your cover image._ You can: 

  * Choose a clip from your video, or
  * Upload an image from your camera roll A Reel with a clear thumbnail image will be much more likely to entice a user to click through when theyâ€™re scrolling through the home feed or hashtag pages. 

### 9] Use audio from other reels

<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-7583 size-full" title="Use audio from other reels" src="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Use-audio-from-other-reels.png" alt="Use audio from other reels" width="700" height="396" srcset="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Use-audio-from-other-reels.png 700w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Use-audio-from-other-reels-300x170.png 300w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Use-audio-from-other-reels-696x394.png 696w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /> When watching other reels, you like audio and want to use it for your reel&#8217;s video. Then you can do it by clicking the _Use aazudio_ option after tapping the music of the particular reel video. Now the reels menu is set to use the song you choose, and you can&#8217;t change the audio. 

### 10] Use Hashtags The Instagram algorithm can use a hashtag to help analyze a post and serve it toward more relevant audiences, even without Instagram Reels insights. For example, using hashtags like

 _#easyrecipes, #mealideas,_ and _#dinnerinspiration_ will indicate to the Instagram Reels algorithm that your content is about food, and hashtags _#naturelove_ _#beautyofnature_ will indicate that your content is about nature. It may increase the likelihood of it being served to users who are actively engaging with similar content. And also catch the interest of people who are nature lovers. Now, Instagram&#8217;s _keyword search_ has rolled out to more countries, so your content will be found by users searching for related topics. These were some of the useful tricks you can apply while making your reels and make your video look more enhanced and attractive. I hope this post will help you to know about_Â useful Instagram Reels tips and tricks._
