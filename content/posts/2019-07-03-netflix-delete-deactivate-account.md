Netflix is easily among the most popular video streaming services right now. It has an exhaustive collection of movies and series. For some reason though, you might want to delete your Netflix account. In this guide, we will share step by step process to Delete or Deactivate Netflix Account. 

## **How to Delete or Deactivate Netflix Account** There is no nuclear button to delete or deactivate your Netflix account, and at best, you can only cancel your Netflix membership. I would recommend you to follow the steps below to make sure none of your data is left on the server after you cancel or delete your Netflix account. 

  1. Cancel Netflix Membership
  2. Remove linked Phone numbers, Emails, and Profiles
  3. Remove Payment methods

### **1) Cancel Netflix Membership**

  * Go to Netflix <a href="https://www.netflix.com/youraccount" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Account Page.</a>
  * Under Membership & Billing, click on **Cancel Membership.** You will get a prompt to confirm this action.

  * Go to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/account/subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My Subscriptions</a> on Play Store
  * Click on the Manage button next to Netflix
  * Choose to cancel the membership The subscription will stop at the end of the next billing cycle or month. Netflix does not allow iPhone/iPad users to subscribe directly from the App Store. So, iOS users also need to follow the same steps as mentioned above. If you want to delete your account immediately, you need to contact Netflix via email. Using the same account, you created the Netflix account, contact privacy@netflix.com. Make sure to mention the same in the email. 

### **2) Remove Phone Numbers, Emails, and Profiles from Netflix** Netflix claims it does not store any data, but since you are not going to use the account anymore, it is best to remove all personal data. 

<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-362 aligncenter" src="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Change-Email-Phonenumber-Payment-Netflix.png" alt="Change Email Phone number Payment Netflix" width="600" height="330" srcset="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Change-Email-Phonenumber-Payment-Netflix.png 600w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Change-Email-Phonenumber-Payment-Netflix-300x165.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> **Phone Number:** Go to Netflix Account Page and click on **Change Phone Number**. On the next screen, you will have the option to Delete the Phone Number. **Remove Profiles:** [Netflix keeps track of your watch habits][1] and suggests similar content. If you do not want Netflix to keep that data, it is best to cover your tracks.<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-361 size-full" title="Delete or Deactivate Netflix Account" src="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Delete-Netflix-Profile.png" alt="Delete Netflix Profile" width="600" height="331" srcset="https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Delete-Netflix-Profile.png 600w, https://www.technetguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Delete-Netflix-Profile-300x166.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> Click on the profile icon, followed by Manage Profiles. Except for your profile, you get a delete option for all other profiles. Post deletion, all the Netflix history related to that profile is also removed from the server. **Remove Email account: ** On your account page, you have the option to change your email account. You can replace the email account with a dummy email account that you don&#8217;t plan to use. 

### **3) Remove Payment Method from Netflix** There is no way to remove credit card information linked to your Netflix account. What you can do, however, is create a virtual credit card. Create one and add it to the Netflix payment method. Next, remove the previous payment details. Netflix claims that once the account is removed, all the payment methods are also deleted from the servers. According to Netflix, an account is 

**automatically deleted** if it stays idle for ten months. Once you complete all these steps, send them an email asking them to speed up the process. _Post these steps; it will be a lot safer to delete the Netflix account as no personal data remain with your account anymore.
